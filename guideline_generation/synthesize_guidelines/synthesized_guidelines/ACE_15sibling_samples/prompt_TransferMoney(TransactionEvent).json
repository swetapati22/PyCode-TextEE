        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions involving the transfer of money from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'pay', 'give', 'settle', 'funded', and 'cost'.",
            "The event is characterized by the movement of monetary value, typically involving a giver and a recipient. It is distinct from other transaction events that may involve the transfer of goods or services.",
            "Unlike TransferOwnership, this event does not involve the transfer of physical or intellectual property. Triggers such as 'providing' and 'selling' are indicative of TransferOwnership, not TransferMoney.",
            "The event often involves financial transactions, settlements, fines, or payments, and can occur in various contexts such as legal settlements, donations, or commercial transactions.",
            "The outcome of the event is the successful transfer of money, which can be identified by the presence of monetary amounts and the entities involved in the transaction."

            "The beneficiary can be an individual, organization, or group. Examples include 'research center' funded by a donation or 'neighbor' compensated for distress.",
            "Unlike the recipient, the beneficiary is the one who gains from the transaction, which may not always be the direct receiver of the funds."

        "giver": [
            "The giver is the entity that provides the money in the transaction. Examples are 'Planned Parenthood' in a donation or 'girls' in a compensation case.",

            "In commercial contexts, the giver could be a business or individual making a payment. Examples include 'houses' in an auction settlement or 'Mikhail Gorbachev' funding a research center.",
            "The giver can be an individual, organization, or group. Examples include 'Christie's' in a settlement or 'clients' paying a fine.",

        "recipient": [
